Pineapple Lock Screen is a small, simple, clean, and fast application that helps you turn your phone screen off (lock screen) without using the physical power button. This could help you increase the life of your physical power button, just in case your power physical button is near broken.

This application makes use of the Android accessibility feature so it doesn't require root privilege to work.

✓ One tap to lock the screen
✓ You can create a shortcut to lock the screen without opening the application
✓ Create shortcut without the app icon in the corner*
✓ Follow system color theme (light/dark)

USAGE

Once installed, you need to enable its associated accessibility service to work. Just follow the in-application description and nothing more than that.

Please note that every time you reboot or for any other reason the application is force stopped, you need to re-enable the accessibility service.

You can also create a shortcut on your launcher to turn the screen off without entering the application, it's not required and you can also remove the shortcut when you no longer need it.

If you think this application is helpful, consider getting the Plus version to support development and you will get some extra experimental features: https://link.blumia.net/lockscreenplus-playstore
